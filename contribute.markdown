From time to time, you might find that you have a spare hour and an idea for a localization tip (post) that would like to share on loc.tips. Now you might think this is wishfull thinking on my part, but I can imagine a world where this might happen. I happen to have a great imagination!

Here's what you'll get. A place to vent, voice your opinion or share your idea. Some credit--you can say you're a published author (on the internet at least). You can put a link to your personal blog, LinkedIn profile or a link to a cat meme, whatever is important to you.

For me to publish the tip on loc.tips it needs to be: related to the software localization industry in some way, readable, of interest to people other than you. I'm a pretty reasonable guy so I'll publish anything that I think is interesting or useful. 

Now that that's of that out of the way, here's what you need to do to have your tip appear on loc.tips.

**1. Create a Github account (if you don't have one already)**

It take like 30 seconds at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). All the cool kids are doing it.

**2. Fork the loc.tips repository** 

Go to [https://github.com/nsuitter/nsuitter.github.io](https://github.com/nsuitter/nsuitter.github.io), click the fork button.

**3. Create a new .markdown or HTML file in the** `_posts` **directory**

Click on the `_posts` folder and then click 'New file'

**4. Compose your localization tip**

This file can either be HTML or Markdown. Either way, the name needs to use the convention YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown\|html and have the Front Matter shown in the screenshot. If you would like to see examples, you can take a look at the other articles in the `_post` directory.

**5. Create a pull request**

Click on the 'New Pull Request' button on your fork homepage and then the 'Create Pull Request' on the next page

We can then collaborate on your localization tip, I might suggest some edits and then merge when it looks good. You can hope to see your tip right away. Happy contributing!
