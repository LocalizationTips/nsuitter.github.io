title:  "The four pillars of localization"
description: "This article lays out four things that need to be in place necessary to take a proactive approach to software localization. This framework can be used as a reference for product owners, localization project managers and developers"

Software localization can be mostly easy and transactional or extremely difficult and time-consuming. It's basically a choose-your-own-adventure-type undertaking, and largely depends on one thing--to what extent was the product designed and coded with internationalization and localization in mind. The answer to this largely predicts whether localization will be a pleasant, predictable, scalable task, or a exercise in testing the body's ability to cope with stress.

The nature of software is that it is developed incredibly rapidly and the minimum viable product is released as soon as possible. Lather, rinse, repeat. The natural symptom of this is that if it doesn't absolutely need to be done for this release, it won't be. Incredibly rapid design/development/testing/release cycles often tack on localization as an afterthought. When expanding to international markets comes as a directive from the C-suite, the first thought that comes to mind is, 'cool, now all we have to do it translate the app, strategic documentation, and marketing copy'. If you're in the localization industry or have dealt with localization efforts before, you probably feel an aneurism coming on right about now.

#### Localization is never as easy as translating words

This knowledge is firmly engrained in your psyche if you've been anywhere near a localization project. Let me reiterate for the uninitiated. **Localization is never as easy as translating words**. Basically, it boils down to this: software is inherently formulaic; language and culture are not.

Now, it isn't usually feasible to make a different version of your website or web app for each new market you launch in, although this can be done if there is business justification. But designing, testing and coding your app with localization in mind will greatly reduce the localization-related issues that usually aren't caught until the week before your international release--usually there are enough issues found in this time to take a year off a localizers life if (s)he hopes to fix most of the issue before go live date.

This headache can be largely avoided if the four pillars of localization are in place before you even start thinking about localization.

|Pillar              |Description|
|:-------------------|:----------|
| Design             | Design with localization in mind. Account for text expansion, choose fonts that support international character sets |
| Pseudolocalization | Test how translations will display in your app before you even start translation. Find and fix layout issues, truncation, improper concatenation, hard-coded text and display issues |
| Context            | Give your translators context in the form of product documentation, product overview videos, screenshots of the UI, and code comments |
| LQA                | Have a good way to test your translations in-context |

I will dedicate a blog post to each of these pillars in the coming weeks. Stay tuned...
