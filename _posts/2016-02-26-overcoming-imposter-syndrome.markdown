As discussed in and [earlier post](../complaining-is-not-localization), it is quite common for localizers to feel a bit intimidated when working with developers that ask them technical questions. Mostly because we're afraid of being seen as dumb when we answer with "I don't know". Questions I've been asked range from whether or not to include escaped markup in a translatable string (hint: you usually do for inline elements) to the benefits of serving strings up from a cache vs. a database. These kinds of questions can be hard to answer and it's easy to feel out of your depth.

#### Don't give into the temptation to sound like you know what you're talking about (unless you do)

It's easy to want to sound competent when you actually have no idea what you're taking about, but it usually backfires and you make a fool of yourself. On the off chance, when you do manage to pull the wool over someone's eyes, you have to live in the fear that they will find you out as a charlatan and you will lose your job or be demoted. It's basically a lose-lose.

I was having a conversation with a co-worker the other day and he was saying that he had worked at some incredibly competitive companies and you would be shunned or potentially fired for admitting you didn't know something. If you work at a company like this you can either look for work elsewhere or say, "I think the serving up labels from the cache is probably the best option, but let me check on some things and circle back". Then do some research, phone a friend or ask the audience. I find it's usually easiest to say, ‘I'm not sure, but I’ll get back to your by the end of the day’, and actually do follow up. It depends on your style. Pretending like you know when you don’t is usually the worst decision you can make though.

#### Learn some skills

Once you've overcome the fear of admitting that you don't know (or perfected the art saying this without actually saying it), it's time to add some skills to your arsenal. Since most people historically come into the localization from a linguistic background, they are kind of light on technical skills. The nice thing is that there are a ton of free online resources for localizers to brush up on their technical skills. These are things that I think that an LPM should know at a bare minimum:

* Command line - navigating your computer, shell scripting to automate your and your teams tasks, general familiarity with the file system and how computers work in general

	* [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Backbone of the web. It's good to have an idea of what all the fuss is about

* Ruby on Rails - This is a prolific framework and it has an easy-to-use i18n library so you can get a quick and dirty idea of how web app localization works under the hood

* git/Github - All source code lives somewhere and that somewhere is usually Github (unless you work at an older company). If you can control when your localized content gets committed as opposed to devs doing it for you, you hold the keys to the kingdom

#### Realize it's all in your head

This is probably the hardest thing to achieve because it requires changing the way you perceive reality and people are pretty attached to thinking the world is a certain way. It's comforting to have something to blame for the discomfort caused by not knowing exactly what you're doing. I'm not technical enough, my boss doesn't give me the support I need, the product owner is being a pain. These are excuses we make for our own feeling of incompetence. It's okay not to know everything, but it's important not to let yourself off the hook in an unproductive way (i.e. making excuses). You have your own set of skills that you bring to the table and you contribute to a product in a meaningful way. So instead of hiding behind your feeling of incompetence, admit to yourself that you don't know, focus on honing your skills and gain some confidence. You'll be a lot more fun to work with and you'll find that you enjoy your job more when you feel you’re in control of your own destiny.
